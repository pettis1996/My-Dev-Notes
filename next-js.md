# NextJS

# Notes

## 1 - Getting Started

### What is Next.js

Next.js is a **React framework** for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and **Next.js for additional features and optimizations**.

Under the hood, Next.js also **abstracts** and **automatically configures** tooling needed for React, like **bundling**, **compiling**, and more. This allows you to focus on building your application instead of spending time with configuration.

### Main Features

Some of the main Next.js features include:

| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Routing | A file-system based router built on top of Server Components that supports layouts, nested routing, loading states, error handling, and more. |
| Rendering | Client-side and Server-side Rendering with Client and Server Components. Further optimized with Static and Dynamic Rendering on the server with Next.js. Streaming on Edge and Node.js runtimes. |
| Data Fetching | Simplified data fetching with async/await in Server Components, and an extended fetch API for request memoization, data caching and revalidation. |
| Styling | Support for your preferred styling methods, including CSS Modules, Tailwind CSS, and CSS-in-JS |
| Optimizations | Image, Fonts, and Script Optimizations to improve your application's Core Web Vitals and User Experience. |
| TypeScript | Improved support for TypeScript, with better type checking and more efficient compilation, as well as custom TypeScript Plugin and type checker. |

### App Router vs Pages Router

Next.js has **two different routers**: the **App Router** and the **Pages Router**. 

The App Router is a newer router that **allows you to use React's latest features**, such as Server Components and Streaming. 

The Pages Router is the original Next.js router, which **allowed you to build server-rendered React applications** and continues to be supported for older Next.js applications.

## 2 - Installation



### System Requirements



- [Node.js 18.17](https://nodejs.org/) or later.
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported.

### Automatic Installation



```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

On installation, you'll see the following prompts:

```bash
What is your project named? my-app
Would you like to use TypeScript? No / Yes
Would you like to use ESLint? No / Yes
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? No / Yes
Would you like to use `src/` directory? No / Yes
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) No / Yes
Would you like to customize the default import alias (@/*)? No / Yes
What import alias would you like configured? @/*
```

After the prompts, `create-next-app` will create a folder with your project name and install the required dependencies.

### Manual Installation



To manually create a new **Next.js app**, install the required packages:

```bash
npm install next@latest react@latest react-dom@latest
```

Open your `package.json` file and add the following `scripts`:

```bash
{
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "next dev",
    "build": "next build",
    "start": "next start",
    "lint": "next lint"
  }
}
```

These scripts refer to the different stages of developing an application:

- `dev`: runs `[next dev](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#development)` to start Next.js in development mode.
- `build`: runs `[next build](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#build)` to build the application for production usage.
- `start`: runs `[next start](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#production)` to start a Next.js production server.
- `lint`: runs `[next lint](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-cli#lint)` to set up Next.js' built-in ESLint configuration.

**Creating Directories**

Next.js uses file-system routing, which means the routes in your application are determined by how you structure your files.

**The `app` Directory**

For new applications, we recommend using the **App Router**. 

This router allows you to use React's latest features and is an evolution of the **Pages Router** based on community feedback.

Create an `app/` folder, then add a `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` file. These will be rendered when the user visits the root of your application (`/`).

Create a **root layout** inside `app/layout.tsx` with the required `<html>` and `<body>` tags:

```tsx
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>{children}</body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

Finally, create a home page `app/page.tsx` with some initial content:

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

> **Good to know**: If you forget to create `layout.tsx`, Next.js will automatically create this file when running the development server with `next dev`.
> 

**The `pages` Directory (Optional)**

If you prefer to use the Pages Router instead of the App Router, you can create a `pages/` directory at the root of your project.

Then, add an `index.tsx` file inside your `pages` folder. This will be your home page (`/`):

```tsx
export default function Page() {
  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>
}
```

Next, add an `_app.tsx` file inside `pages/` to define the global layout. Learn more about the [custom App file](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-app).

```tsx
import type { AppProps } from 'next/app'
 
export default function App({ Component, pageProps }: AppProps) {
  return <Component {...pageProps} />
}
```

Finally, add a `_document.tsx` file inside `pages/` to control the initial response from the server. Learn more about the [custom Document file](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/custom-document).

```tsx
import { Html, Head, Main, NextScript } from 'next/document'
 
export default function Document() {
  return (
    <Html>
      <Head />
      <body>
        <Main />
        <NextScript />
      </body>
    </Html>
  )
}
```

Learn more about [using the Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts).

**The `public` folder (Optional)**

Create a `public` folder to store static assets such as images, fonts, etc. Files inside `public` directory can then be referenced by your code starting from the base URL (`/`).

### Run the Development Server

1. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.
2. Visit `http://localhost:3000` to view your application.
3. Edit `app/page.tsx` (or `pages/index.tsx`) file and save it to see the updated result in your browser.

## 3 - Building Your Application



### A - Routing



******************************************Routing Fundementals******************************************

The skeleton of every application is routing. This page will introduce you to the **fundamental concepts** of routing for the web and how to handle routing in Next.js.

************Terminology************

First, you will see these terms being used throughout the documentation. Here's a quick reference:

[https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fterminology-component-tree.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_9jreweDj1d1RFNt2yi7F9bctztm3](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fterminology-component-tree.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_9jreweDj1d1RFNt2yi7F9bctztm3)

- **Tree:** A convention for visualizing a hierarchical structure. For example, a component tree with **parent** and **children** components, a **folder structure**, etc.
- **Subtree:** Part of a tree, **starting at a new root** (first) and **ending at the leaves** (last).
- **Root**: The **first node** in a **tree** or **subtree**, such as a root layout.
- **Leaf:** **Nodes** in a **subtree** that have **no children**, such as the last segment in a URL path.

[https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fterminology-url-anatomy.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_9jreweDj1d1RFNt2yi7F9bctztm3](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fterminology-url-anatomy.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_9jreweDj1d1RFNt2yi7F9bctztm3)

- **URL Segment:** Part of the URL path delimited by slashes.
- **URL Path:** Part of the URL that comes after the domain (composed of segments).

******************The `app` Router**

In version 13, Next.js introduced a new **App Router** built on [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components), which supports **shared layouts**, **nested routing**, **loading states**, **error handling**, and more.

The App Router works in a new directory named `app`. The `app` directory works alongside the `pages` directory to allow for incremental adoption. This allows you to opt some routes of your application into the new behavior while keeping other routes in the `pages` directory for previous behavior. If your application uses the `pages` directory, please also see the [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing) documentation.

> **Good to know**: The App Router takes priority over the Pages Router. Routes across directories should not resolve to the same URL path and will cause a build-time error to prevent a conflict.
> 

[https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fnext-router-directories.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_9jreweDj1d1RFNt2yi7F9bctztm3](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Fnext-router-directories.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_9jreweDj1d1RFNt2yi7F9bctztm3)

By default, components inside `app` are [React Server Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components). This is a performance optimization and allows you to easily adopt them, and you can also use [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/client-components).

> **Recommendation:** Check out the [Server](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/server-components) page if you're new to Server Components.

****************************************************Roles of Folders and Files****************************************************

Next.js uses a file-system based router where:

- **Folders** are used to define routes. A route is a single path of nested folders, following the file-system hierarchy from the **root folder** down to a final **leaf folder** that includes a `page.js` file. See [Defining Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/defining-routes).
- **Files** are used to create UI that is shown for a route segment. See [special files](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing#file-conventions).

********Route Segments********

Each folder in a route represents a **route segment**. Each route segment is mapped to a corresponding **segment** in a **URL path**.

[https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-segments-to-path-segments.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_9jreweDj1d1RFNt2yi7F9bctztm3](https://nextjs.org/_next/image?url=%2Fdocs%2Fdark%2Froute-segments-to-path-segments.png&w=1920&q=75&dpl=dpl_9jreweDj1d1RFNt2yi7F9bctztm3)

************Nested Routes************ 

To create a nested route, you can nest folders inside each other. For example, you can add a new `/dashboard/settings` route by nesting two new folders in the `app` directory.

The `/dashboard/settings` route is composed of three segments:

- `/` (Root segment)
- `dashboard` (Segment)
- `settings` (Leaf segment)

********************************File Conventions********************************

Next.js provides a set of special files to create UI with specific behavior in nested routes:

| https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#layouts | Shared UI for a segment and its children |
| --- | --- |
| https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#pages | Unique UI of a route and make routes publicly accessible |
| https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/loading-ui-and-streaming | Loading UI for a segment and its children |
| https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/not-found | Not found UI for a segment and its children |
| https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling | Error UI for a segment and its children |
| https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/error-handling | Global Error UI |
| https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers | Server-side API endpoint |
| https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/pages-and-layouts#templates | Specialized re-rendered Layout UI |
| https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/default | Fallback UI for https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes |

> **Good to know**: `.js`, `.jsx`, or `.tsx` file extensions can be used for special files.
