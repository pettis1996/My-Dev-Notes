    <p>
        <b>FastAPI</b> is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key features are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Fast:</b> Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to **Starlette** and **Pydantic**). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Fast to code:</b> Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Fewer bugs:</b> Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
        </li>
        <li>    
            <b>Intuitive:</b> Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Short:</b> Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Robust:</b> Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Standards-based:</b> Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
