# Python - FastAPI Framework Notes

## Introduction

<blockquote>
    <p>
        **FastAPI** is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.
    </p>
    <p>
        The key features are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            **Fast**: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to **Starlette** and **Pydantic**). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.
        </li>
        <li>
            **Fast to code**: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. *
        </li>
        <li>
            **Fewer bugs**: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. *
        </li>
        <li>    
            **Intuitive**: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
        <li>
        <li>
            **Easy**: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
        </li>
        <li>
            **Short**: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
        </li>
        <li>
            **Robust**: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
            **Standards-based**: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
        </li>
    </ul>
