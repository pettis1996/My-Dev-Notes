            <strong>ElectronJS</strong>, often referred to simply as Electron, is an open-source framework for building <strong>cross-platform desktop applications</strong> using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was initially developed by GitHub and has since gained widespread popularity in the software development community. Electron allows developers to create desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux without having to learn platform-specific programming languages or frameworks.
