    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>ElectronJS</strong>, often referred to simply as Electron, is an open-source framework for building <strong>cross-platform desktop applications</strong> using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was initially developed by GitHub and has since gained widespread popularity in the software development community. Electron allows developers to create desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux without having to learn platform-specific programming languages or frameworks.

        Running Examples with Electron Fiddle
    </summary>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle">Electron Fiddle</a> is a sandbox app written with Electron and supported by Electron's maintainers. It is highly recommended installing it as a learning tool to experiment with Electron's APIs or to prototype features during development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fiddle also integrates nicely with electron's documentation. When browsing through examples in electron's tutorials, you'll frequently see an "Open in Electron Fiddle" button underneath a code block. If you have Fiddle installed, this button will open a fiddle.electronjs.org link that will automatically load the example into Fiddle, no copy-pasting required.
