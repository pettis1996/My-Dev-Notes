        What is ElectronJS and what is it used for?
    </summary>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <strong>ElectronJS</strong>, often referred to simply as Electron, is an open-source framework for building <strong>cross-platform desktop applications</strong> using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was initially developed by GitHub and has since gained widespread popularity in the software development community. Electron allows developers to create desktop applications for Windows, macOS, and Linux without having to learn platform-specific programming languages or frameworks.

        Running Examples with Electron Fiddle
    </summary>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/fiddle">Electron Fiddle</a> is a sandbox app written with Electron and supported by Electron's maintainers. It is highly recommended installing it as a learning tool to experiment with Electron's APIs or to prototype features during development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fiddle also integrates nicely with electron's documentation. When browsing through examples in electron's tutorials, you'll frequently see an "Open in Electron Fiddle" button underneath a code block. If you have Fiddle installed, this button will open a fiddle.electronjs.org link that will automatically load the example into Fiddle, no copy-pasting required.

        What you will need to begin with
    </summary>
    <br>
    <blockquote>
        <p>
            First, navigate to the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/tutorial/tutorial-prerequisites">Prerequisites</a> page, to see what you will need to install on your machine in order to begin with using ElectronJS.
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important prerequisites to have are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Github
            </li>
            <li>
                (Optional) Visual Studio Code
            </li>
            <li>
                (Optional) Github Desktop
            </li>
            <li>
                NodeJS and NPM/NPX/NVM Installed
            </li>
        </ul>
        <blockquote>
            <p>
                <strong>
                    ‚ö†Ô∏è CAUTION ‚ö†Ô∏è
                </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Although you need Node.js installed locally to scaffold an Electron project, Electron does not use your system's Node.js installation to run its code. Instead, it comes bundled with its own Node.js runtime. This means that your end users do not need to install Node.js themselves as a prerequisite to running your app.
            </p>
            <p>
                To check which version of Node.js is running in your app, you can access the global process.versions variable in the main process or preload script. You can also reference https://releases.electronjs.org/releases.json.
            </p>

<h4>
    Setting up the project

    <p>
        If you are on a <strong>Windows</strong> machine, please <strong>do not</strong> use <strong>Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)</strong> when following this tutorial as you will run into issues when trying to execute the application.
    </p>
</blockquote>
<br>

<h4>
    Initializing the project
</h4>

Electron apps are scaffolded using `npm`, with the `package.json` file as an entry point. Start by creating a folder and initializing an npm package within it with `npm init`.

<strong>
    npm
</strong>
<br>

```bash
    mkdir my-electron-app && cd my-electron-app
    npm init
```

<strong>
    Yarn
</strong>
<br>

```bash
    mkdir my-electron-app && cd my-electron-app
    yarn init
```

This command will prompt you to configure some fields in your `package.json`. There are a few rules to follow for the purposes of this tutorial:

<ul>
    <li>
        entry point should be <strong>main.js</strong> (you will be creating that file soon).
    </li>
    <li>
        author, license, and description can be any value, but will be necessary for packaging later on.
    </li>
</ul>

Then, install Electron into your app's **devDependencies**, which is the list of external **development-only** package dependencies **not required in production**.
<br>

<strong>
    npm
</strong>
<br>

```bash
    npm install electron --save-dev
```

<strong>
    Yarn
</strong>
<br>

```bash
    yarn add electron --dev
```

Your `package.json` file should look something like this after initializing your package and installing **Electron**. You should also now have a node_modules folder containing the `Electron executable`, as well as a `package-lock.json` lockfile that specifies the exact dependency versions to install.

`package.json`
<br>

```json
    {
        "name": "my-electron-app",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "Hello World!",
        "main": "main.js",
        "scripts": {
            "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
        },
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "license": "MIT",
        "devDependencies": {
            "electron": "23.1.3"
        }
    }
```
<br>    

<h4>
    Adding a .gitignore file
</h4>

The `.gitignore` file specifies which files and directories to avoid tracking with **Git**. You should place a copy of <a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Node.gitignore">GitHub's Node.js gitignore template</a> into your project's root folder to avoid committing your project's `node_modules` folder.
<br><br>

### üíª Running an Electron App üíª

The `main` script you defined in `package.json` is the entry point of any Electron application. This script controls the main process, which runs in a `Node.js` environment and is responsible for **controlling your app's lifecycle**, **displaying native interfaces**, **performing privileged operations**, and **managing renderer processes**.

Before creating your first Electron app, you will first use a trivial script to ensure your main process entry point is configured correctly. Create a `main.js` file in the `root` folder of your project with a single line of code:

`main.js`
<br>

```javascript
    console.log('Hello from Electron üëã')
```
<br>

Because Electron's main process is a `Node.js` runtime, you can execute arbitrary `Node.js` code with the electron command (you can even use it as a **REPL**). To execute this script, add `electron .` to the `start` command in the scripts field of your `package.json`. This command will tell the Electron executable to look for the main script in the current directory and run it in **dev mode**.

```json
    {
        "name": "my-electron-app",
        "version": "1.0.0",
        "description": "Hello World!",
        "main": "main.js",
        "scripts": {
            "start": "electron .",
            "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
        },
        "author": "Jane Doe",
        "license": "MIT",
        "devDependencies": {
            "electron": "23.1.3"
        }
    }
```
<br>

<strong>
    npm
</strong>
<br>

```bash
    npm run start
```

<strong>
    Yarn
</strong>
<br>

```bash
    yarn run start
```

Your terminal should print out `Hello from Electron üëã`. 
**Congratulations**, you have executed your first line of code in Electron! Next, you will learn how to create user interfaces with `HTML` and load that into a native window.
<br><br>

### üíª Loading a web page into a BrowserWindow üíª

In Electron, each **window** displays a **web page** that can be loaded either from a local `HTML file` or a `remote web address`. For this example, you will be loading in a local file. Start by creating a barebones web page in an `index.html` file in the `root` folder of your project:

`index.html`
<br>

```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
            <meta charset="UTF-8" />
            <!-- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP -->
            <meta
            http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy"
            content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'"
            />
            <meta
            http-equiv="X-Content-Security-Policy"
            content="default-src 'self'; script-src 'self'"
            />
            <title>Hello from Electron renderer!</title>
        </head>
        <body>
            <h1>Hello from Electron renderer!</h1>
            <p>üëã</p>
        </body>
    </html>
```
<br>

Now that you have a web page, you can load it into an **Electron BrowserWindow**. Replace the contents of your `main.js` file with the following code.

`main.js`
<br>

```javascript
    const { app, BrowserWindow } = require('electron')

    const createWindow = () => {
        const win = new BrowserWindow({
            width: 800,
            height: 600
        })

        win.loadFile('index.html')
    }

    app.whenReady().then(() => {
        createWindow()
    })
```
<br>

<h4>
    Importing modules
</h4>
<br>

In the first line, we are importing two Electron modules with **CommonJS** module syntax:

- <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/app">app</a>, which controls your application's event lifecycle.
- <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/latest/api/browser-window">BrowserWindow</a>, which creates and manages app windows.
<br>

<h4>
    Writing a reusable function to instantiate windows
</h4>
<br>

`main.js (Lines 3-10)`
<br>

```javascript
    const createWindow = () => {
        const win = new BrowserWindow({
            width: 800,
            height: 600
        })

        win.loadFile('index.html')
    }
```
<br>

<h4>
    Calling your function when the app is ready
</h4>
<br>

```javascript
    app.whenReady().then(() => {
        createWindow()
    })
```

Many of Electron's core modules are `Node.js` event emitters that adhere to Node's asynchronous event-driven architecture. The app module is one of these emitters.

In Electron, **BrowserWindows** can only be created after the app module's `ready` event is fired. You can wait for this event by using the `app.whenReady()` API and calling `createWindow()` once its promise is fulfilled.

At this point, running your Electron application's `start` command should successfully open a window that displays your web page!

Each web page your app displays in a window will run in a separate process called a **renderer process** (or simply renderer for short). Renderer processes have access to the same **JavaScript APIs** and tooling you use for typical front-end web development, such as using **webpack** to bundle and minify your code or **React** to build your user interfaces.
