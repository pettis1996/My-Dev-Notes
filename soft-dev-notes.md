        </h5>
        Agile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails.

        When it comes to implementing <b>Agile</b> and <b>DevOps</b>, <b>kanban</b> and <b>scrum</b> provide different ways to do so.
        It's easy to point out the differences between scrum practices and kanban practices, but that's just at the <b>surface level</b>. 
        While the practices differ, the principles are largely the same. Both frameworks will help you build better products (and services) with fewer headaches.
