        </h5>
        Agile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails.

        When it comes to implementing <b>Agile</b> and <b>DevOps</b>, <b>kanban</b> and <b>scrum</b> provide different ways to do so.
    </P>
    <p>
        It's easy to point out the differences between scrum practices and kanban practices, but that's just at the <b>surface level</b>. 
        While the practices differ, the principles are largely the same. Both frameworks will help you build better products (and services) with fewer headaches.

    <summary>What is Kanban</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <b>Kanban</b> is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency (or flow). Kanban teams focus on <b>reducing the time</b> a project takes (or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work.

    <summary>What is Scrum</summary>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <b>Scrum</b> teams commit to completing an increment of work, which is potentially shippable, through set intervals called sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. Scrum teams <b>adopt specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular ceremonies</b> to keep things moving forward. Scrum is best defined in <b>The Scrum Guide</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
        With scrum, your team promises to ship some valuable increment of work by the end of each sprint. Scrum is built on empiricism, focusing on small increments of work that will help you learn from your customers and better inform what you do next. Here's how it breaks down: 
    </p>
    <p style="display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <b>
            Scrum cadence:
        </b>
        <span>
            Scrum moves fast, with sprints that usually last between one to four weeks, which have clear start and finish dates. The short time frame forces complex tasks to be split into smaller stories and help your team learn quickly. A key question is this: Can your team ship useable code that fast?
            Sprints are punctuated by sprint planning, sprint review, and retrospective meetings and peppered with daily scrum (standup) meetings. These scrum ceremonies are lightweight and run on a continuous basis.
        </span>
    </p>

        <b>
            Scrum roles:
        </b>
        Scrum has three clearly defined roles.
        <ul>
            <li>
                The product owner advocates for the customer, manages the product backlog, and helps prioritize the work done by the development team.
            </li>
            <li>
                The scrum master helps the team stay grounded in the scrum principles.
            </li>
            <li>
                The development team chooses the work to be done, delivers increments, and demonstrates collective accountability.
            </li>
        </ul>  
        Who manages the scrum team? Well, nobody. Scrum teams are self-organizing and everyone is equal, despite having different responsibilities. The team is united by the goal of shipping value to customers.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            Common metrics:
        </b>
        Scrum metrics are data points scrum teams can use to improve efficiency and effectiveness. They can inform decision-making and help teams become more efficient in planning and execution. During the sprint planning phase, teams can use metrics such as sprint goals, team velocity, team capacity, and type of work. During stand-ups, teams can also benefit from measuring progress towards sprint goals, reviewing a sprint burndown, understanding workload distribution, and more.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>
            Change philosophy:
        </b>
        Teams strive to understand how much they can accomplish within their sprint time boundaries. They commit to its delivery within a sprint. However, scrum teams can receive customer feedback that encourages them to pivot and change the sprint to deliver the most customer value. During the sprint retrospective, scrum teams should discuss how to limit change in the future, as changes put the potentially shippable increment at risk. If a team frequently changes scope mid-sprint, it may signify work was selected that isnâ€™t adequately understood. It could also mean the team has operational/unplannable work that interferes with the plan.
