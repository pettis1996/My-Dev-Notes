        </h5>
        Agile is a structured and iterative approach to project management and product development. It recognizes the volatility of product development, and provides a methodology for self-organizing teams to respond to change without going off the rails.

        When it comes to implementing <b>Agile</b> and <b>DevOps</b>, <b>kanban</b> and <b>scrum</b> provide different ways to do so.
    </P>
    <p>
        It's easy to point out the differences between scrum practices and kanban practices, but that's just at the <b>surface level</b>. 
        While the practices differ, the principles are largely the same. Both frameworks will help you build better products (and services) with fewer headaches.

    <summary>What is Kanban</summary>
    <p>
        <b>Kanban</b> is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency (or flow). Kanban teams focus on <b>reducing the time</b> a project takes (or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work.

    <summary>What is Scrum</summary>
    <p>
        <b>Scrum</b> teams commit to completing an increment of work, which is potentially shippable, through set intervals called sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. Scrum teams <b>adopt specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular ceremonies</b> to keep things moving forward. Scrum is best defined in <b>The Scrum Guide</b>.
